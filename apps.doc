ribtest.c - is a simple consumer of _update_ binray streams - arg 1 is a file name.

main.c - is a similar simple parse and write app, however it is aparrently broken, at least with the first large test file i have tried (updates.2019.07).

mrtupdatetest.c - is another consumer of update streams (bgp4mp MRT records). arg 1&2 are input and output file names.
	unlike main.c this works with the large test files at hand
	i speculate that main.c suffers from not handling extended timestamps

mrttest2.c - IIRC this consumes table dumps and update streams and correlates them, amongst other things.

mrttabledumptest.c - reads MRT table dump recirds only.  arg 1 is the input file - typically 'bview....', arg 2 is the index in the peer table to use as the source for
	building a stream of update messages.  Running with just one parameter generates a report which amonst other things identifies the peer with the largets table,
	which can then be used as the input for a second run.  The output file name is fixed as 'table.bin'.

alloctest.c - UNIT TEST
bigtabletest.c - UNIT TEST
